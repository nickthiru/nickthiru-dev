## Notes from Thiru AI Labs Analysis

**Patterns Identified:**
- Content type confusion is common (rules vs skills vs workflows)
- Redundancy across multiple files
- Need for clear categorization
- Verb-based naming conventions for workflows
- Consolidation opportunities in global rules

**Expected Similarities:**
- Content creation focus may lead to similar categorization issues
- Personal branding vs business focus differences
- Potential overlap with general content creation patterns
- Different audience (personal vs business) may require different approaches

**Status**: Ready for next session analysis  
**Next Action**: Begin with AGENTS.md analysis
