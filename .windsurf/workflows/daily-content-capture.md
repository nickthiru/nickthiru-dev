# Daily Content Capture Workflow

## Overview

This workflow implements the proven 15-30 minute daily routine for building in public, turning development work into content systematically.

## When to Use

- Daily routine for consistent content creation
- When building products and sharing progress
- For maintaining audience engagement without burnout
- To create content backlog from development work

## Daily Checklist (15-30 minutes total)

### Morning Routine (5-10 minutes)

**Tasks:**

- [ ] **Reply to comments** on yesterday's posts (LinkedIn, Twitter, blog)
- [ ] **Save 1-3 good posts** from your niche for inspiration
- [ ] **Add 1 bullet** to today's build log (`thiru-ai-labs/build-logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` at workspace root): what you're trying to ship today

**Why it works:**

- Engagement signals to algorithms that your content is valuable
- Inspiration bank prevents "what should I write about" blocks
- Daily goal creates accountability and focus

### During Development (0 extra minutes - just capture)

**Capture one artifact:**

- Screenshot of new feature
- Short Loom clip (1-2 minutes max)
- Terminal output (sanitized)
- Architecture sketch
- Before/after comparison

**Add 3 bullets to today's build log** (`thiru-ai-labs/build-logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` at workspace root):

- **Build:** What changed/what you implemented
- **Why:** User value or problem solved
- **Lesson:** What surprised you or what you learned

**Why it works:**

- Turns development work into content automatically
- No extra time needed - just document as you go
- Creates authentic, detailed content later

### End of Day (10-20 minutes)

**Tasks:**

- [ ] **Choose ONE** item from today's build log (from workspace BUILD_LOG.md)
- [ ] **Draft ONE post** (LinkedIn is the default platform)
- [ ] **Post it** or schedule for tomorrow morning
- [ ] **Optional:** Adapt into short X post/thread

**Why it works:**

- One post per day is sustainable and effective
- LinkedIn posts live longer (24-48 hours)
- Repurposing maximizes content reach

## Build Log Templates

### Feature Entry Template

```markdown
**Build:** [what changed]
**Proof:** [screenshot/clip link]
**User Value:** [why it matters to users]
**Tradeoff:** [latency/cost/UX/privacy consideration]
**Next:** [next step or milestone]
```

### Bug/Failure Entry Template

```markdown
**Symptom:** [what broke or went wrong]

```

## LinkedIn Post Templates

### "I'm building this" (Re-activation)

```markdown
I'm building [product description] that solves [problem].

The challenge I'm addressing:

- [pain point 1]
- [pain point 2]
- [pain point 3]

What I'm building instead:

- [solution approach]
- [key benefit]
- [unique differentiator]

If you're in [target audience]: what's your biggest blocker - [option 1], [option 2], or [option 3]?
```

### Build Log Progress (Daily update)

```markdown
Build log: [Product Name]

Today I got [specific milestone] working.

What it does:
• [feature 1]
• [feature 2]

Why it matters:
[user benefit statement]

Next up: [next milestone]

Question: would you rather [option A] or [option B]?
```

### "I thought X, I was wrong" (Learning)

```markdown
I thought [assumption you made].

I was wrong.

What happened:
• [what you tried]
• [what broke or didn't work]  
• [what you changed]

Lesson: [one sentence key learning]

If you're building with [technology/field]: what's your hardest [specific challenge] right now?
```

### User Insight (High signal)

```markdown
I talked to [N] people who [user context].

Their #1 blocker wasn't [obvious problem].
It was [real blocker].

So I'm building [feature/solution] to solve it:
• [how it works]
• [why it reduces friction]

If you [do this activity]: what's your biggest challenge?
```

### Soft CTA (Beta/waitlist)

```markdown
If you want to test [product] when it's ready:

Comment "beta" and I'll DM you when I open early access.

Limited spots - I want to ensure everyone gets great support.
```

## X/Twitter Templates

### Single Tweet Build Log

```markdown
Build log: [Product Name]

## Weekly Process (60-120 minutes)

### Canonical Blog Post

1. **Review week's build logs** - pick strongest theme
2. **Create outline** using blog post template
3. **Write 800-1500 word post** with personal stories
4. **Add code examples** and screenshots
5. **Include lessons learned** and what you'd do differently
6. **End with call to action** (subscribe, waitlist, feedback)

### Multi-Platform Repurposing

1. **LinkedIn Post**: Professional insights (150-300 words)
2. **X Thread**: Key lessons as thread (7-10 tweets)
3. **Newsletter**: Personal update with behind-the-scenes
4. **Schedule posts** for optimal times

## Privacy & Safety Guidelines

### Always Safe to Share

- Revenue metrics (rounded: "$5K MRR" not "$5,234.12")
- User growth percentages and trends
- Technical process without proprietary details
- Learning experiences and mistakes
- Behind-the-scenes development journey

### Never Share Without Permission

- Customer names or identifying information
- Specific revenue figures from enterprise deals
- Proprietary algorithms or technical IP
- Private user feedback or communications
- Legal, financial, or security-sensitive details

### When in Doubt

- Share the pattern, not the exploitable detail
- Share the learning, not the sensitive data
- Ask: "Could this help competitors or create security risks?"

## Tools & Setup

### Essential Tools

- **Screenshot tool**: Clean, annotated screenshots
- **Loom**: Short screen recordings (1-2 minutes)
- **Build log system**: Workspace-level BUILD_LOG.md in thiru-ai-labs/
- **Scheduling tool**: Buffer, Later, or native platform scheduling
- **Analytics**: Basic tracking to see what resonates

### Build Log Setup

Use workspace-level BUILD_LOG.md (thiru-ai-labs/BUILD_LOG.md) with:

- Date headers for each day
- Template sections for easy entry
- Tags for categorization (feature, bug, insight)
- Links to screenshots/videos

### Content Calendar

Simple tracking of:

- Daily posts (LinkedIn, X)
- Weekly blog posts
- Newsletter sends
- Major milestones

## Timing & Frequency

### Optimal Posting Times

**LinkedIn (Professional audience):**

## Quality Checklist

### Before Posting

- [ ] Does this provide value to my audience?
- [ ] Is it authentic to my voice and experience?
- [ ] Does it respect privacy guidelines?
- [ ] Is there a clear call to action or question?
- [ ] Are there typos or formatting issues?

### Weekly Review

- [ ] Which posts got most engagement?
- [ ] What topics resonated with my audience?
- [ ] What times worked best for posting?
- [ ] Do I need to adjust my content mix?
- [ ] Am I building toward my business goals?

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall: "I don't have anything to share"

**Solution:** Your daily development work IS the content. Use the workspace build log templates (thiru-ai-labs/build-logs/) to capture it systematically.

### Pitfall: "This takes too much time"

**Solution:** The system is designed for 15-30 minutes total. Capture during development (0 extra time), quick draft at end of day.

### Pitfall: "Nobody is engaging"

**Solution:** Focus on providing value first. Ask questions, respond to every comment, engage with others in your niche.

### Pitfall: "I'm worried about sharing too much"

**Solution:** Follow the privacy guidelines. Share patterns and learnings, not sensitive details.

## Success Metrics

### Engagement Indicators

- **Comments per post**: Aim for 2-5 on LinkedIn
- **Follower growth**: 5-10 per day sustainable
- **Profile visits**: 50-200 per week
- **Newsletter signups**: 2-5% of blog readers

### Business Impact

- **Waitlist signups**: Track product interest
- **Customer conversations**: People reaching out about your work
- **Partnership opportunities**: Collaborations and features
- **Authority building**: Speaking invites, podcast requests

## Next Steps

1. **Use workspace build log** (thiru-ai-labs/BUILD_LOG.md) with templates
2. **Schedule daily 15-30 minute blocks** for content routine
3. **Create social media profiles** if not already done
4. **Write your first "I'm building this" post** to re-engage audience
5. **Track metrics for first month** and adjust based on what works
