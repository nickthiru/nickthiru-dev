# Write Business Blog Post

## Overview

This workflow guides you through creating authentic business content that balances transparency with strategic insights, focusing on real metrics, decision frameworks, and the "why" behind business choices.

## Prerequisites

- Clear business topic or decision to share
- Real metrics or data points (even if rounded)
- Personal experience with the business challenge
- Understanding of transparency boundaries

## Steps

### 1. Topic Validation & Transparency Check

Validate your topic and ensure it aligns with transparency guidelines:

```bash
# Validate topic has business value
echo "Ask yourself:
- Does this help other founders/operators?
- What's the key insight or framework?
- What specific metrics can I share?
- What's the transparency decision here?"

# Check privacy guidelines
echo "Review AGENTS.md privacy rules:
- Is this safe to share? (metrics, process, learnings)
- Am I sharing patterns, not exploitable details?
- Would this help competitors or create risk?"

# Identify the core transparency decision
echo "Frame your transparency:
- What I chose to share
- Why I chose to share it
- What I held back (if relevant)"
```

### 2. Data & Metrics Preparation

Gather and organize your business data:

```bash
# Collect specific metrics
echo "Gather concrete data points:
- Revenue numbers (rounded: $5K MRR, not $5,234.12)
- Growth percentages
- Conversion rates
- Time/cost savings
- User counts or engagement metrics"

# Prepare context
echo "Add business context:
- Time period covered
- Market conditions
- Decision constraints
- Alternative options considered"
```

### 3. Outline Creation

Create a business-focused outline using the transparency structure:

```markdown
## Business Post Outline

### Hook (Personal Decision Moment)

- Start with the scary/exciting decision point
- "I made a decision last month that scared me..."
- Show the emotional weight of the choice

### The Transparency Decision

- What you decided to share publicly
- Why this decision (audience trust vs. competitive risk)
- What was scary about sharing this

### What I Shared (The Data)

- Specific metrics and numbers
- The context behind the numbers
- Visuals or simple charts if helpful

### Business Impact

- What happened after sharing
- Audience response (metrics if available)
- Unexpected benefits or consequences

### The Scary Part

- What made you nervous about this
- What could have gone wrong
- How you managed the risk

### What Actually Happened

- Real outcomes (good and bad)
- Surprises or unexpected results
- Ongoing effects

### Guidelines for Others

- Framework or mental model
- When to apply this approach
- What to watch out for
- Your "if I were starting today" advice
```

### 4. Draft Creation

Write the first draft focusing on authenticity and strategic value:

```bash
# Writing focus areas
echo "Prioritize these elements:
- Personal decision narrative
- Specific, honest metrics
- Strategic insights and frameworks
- Vulnerability about fears/mistakes
- Actionable guidance for others"

# Voice checklist
echo "Maintain authentic business voice:
- Strategic yet practical
- Data-informed but not academic
- Framework-oriented thinking
- Honest about tradeoffs
- Forward-looking insights"
```

### 5. Quality Review

Review against business content standards:

```bash
# Business content checklist
echo "Verify these elements:
[ ] Specific metrics and data points included
[ ] Clear framework or mental model provided
[ ] Strategic insights with practical application
[ ] Both successes and failures shared transparently
[ ] Repeatable patterns extracted from experience
[ ] The 'why' behind business decisions explained
[ ] Privacy guidelines respected"
```

### 6. SEO & Distribution Optimization

Optimize for business audience:

```bash
# Business SEO focus
echo "Target these keywords:
- Business strategy terms
- Founder/operational challenges
- Industry-specific topics
- 'How to' and 'why' questions"

# Distribution angles
echo "Plan business-focused distribution:
- LinkedIn: Strategic insights and frameworks
- Twitter: Key metrics and decisions
- Newsletter: Behind-the-scenes business journey
- Blog: Complete strategic analysis"
```

## Business Content Templates
