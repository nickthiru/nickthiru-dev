# Write Product Blog Post

## Overview

This workflow guides you through creating product-focused content that showcases development progress, highlights user value, and maintains momentum while sharing authentic build experiences.

## Prerequisites

- Clear product update or feature to share
- Understanding of user problem being solved
- Development progress or milestones achieved
- User feedback or usage data (if available)

## Steps

### 1. Product Story Validation

Validate your product update has a compelling story:

```bash
# Identify the core user value
echo "Ask yourself:
- What problem does this solve for users?
- How does this make their life better?
- What's the 'before and after' for users?
- Why did I build this specifically?"

# Check development significance
echo "Evaluate technical progress:
- What milestone does this represent?
- What technical challenges were overcome?
- What did I learn building this?
- How does this fit the roadmap?"

# Assess story potential
echo "Look for narrative elements:
- Personal motivation for building this
- Unexpected challenges or discoveries
- User reactions or feedback
- What this enables for the future"
```

### 2. User-Centric Framing

Frame the update from the user's perspective:

```bash
# User benefit analysis
echo "Map user value propositions:
- Primary benefit: [main user problem solved]
- Secondary benefits: [additional improvements]
- Time/effort saved: [quantify if possible]
- New capabilities: [what users can now do]

# Use case identification
echo "Define specific use cases:
- Who benefits most from this?
- What scenarios does this enable?
- How does this fit into their workflow?
- What problems does this eliminate?"
```

### 3. Development Progress Documentation

Gather the development story:

```bash
# Technical journey
echo "Document the build process:
- Initial idea and motivation
- Technical approach chosen
- Key challenges faced
- Breakthrough moments
- Current status and capabilities"

# Learning and insights
echo "Capture development insights:
- What worked better than expected?
- What was harder than anticipated?
- What would I do differently?
- What does this enable for future features?"
```

### 4. Outline Creation

Create a product-focused outline using the product structure:

```markdown
## Product Post Outline

- Start with the user problem or your "why"
- "I kept hearing from users that..." or "Last month I decided to..."
- Show the personal investment in solving this

```

### 5. Draft Creation

Write the first draft focusing on user value and development authenticity:

```bash
# Writing focus areas
echo "Prioritize these elements:
- User problems and solutions
- Development progress and momentum
- Technical details without overwhelming
- Personal motivation and challenges
- Future direction and user involvement"

# Voice checklist
echo "Maintain product-focused voice:

```

### 6. Quality Review

Review against product content standards:

```bash
# Product content checklist
echo "Verify these elements:

[ ] Technical details included without overwhelming
[ ] Development challenges shared honestly

```

### 7. User Engagement & Distribution
