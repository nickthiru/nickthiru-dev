# Methodology Series: Documentation Plan

**Series Title:** "From Web Apps to AI Agents: A Developer's Journey"

**Status:** Outlines complete, ready for writing  
**Target:** Publish all 3 articles on nickthiru.dev (backdated later)  
**Purpose:** Establish expertise, pad website content, educate audience

---

## Series Overview

### Articles

1. **The Web Dev Methodology That Still Works (For Traditional Apps)**

   - Establishes credibility with traditional methodology
   - Shows it's not obsolete, just not universal
   - Sets up the contrast with AI development
   - **Outline:** `docs/article-outlines/01-traditional-web-dev-methodology.md`

2. **Why Traditional Development Methodology Breaks for AI Agentic Systems**

   - Shows real failures and learnings
   - Explains the paradigm shift (engineering vs discovery)
   - Builds trust through vulnerability
   - **Outline:** `docs/article-outlines/02-why-traditional-breaks-for-ai.md`

3. **A Lean Methodology for AI Agentic Development**
   - Provides the solution (hybrid approach)
   - Actionable, practical guidance
   - Real examples from LinkedIn Ghostwriter
   - **Outline:** `docs/article-outlines/03-lean-ai-methodology.md`

### Key Decision: Article 4 Dropped

**Original plan:** 4 articles including "Building in Public"  
**Decision:** Drop Article 4 - build log workflow is competitive advantage  
**Rationale:** Privacy guidelines and workflow are your edge, keep them private

## Series Navigation Component

Every article will include this at the top:

```markdown
> **Part of a 3-article series:** From Web Apps to AI Agents: A Developer's Journey
>
> 1. [The Web Dev Methodology That Still Works](#) ← Update with actual URLs
> 2. [Why Traditional Methodology Breaks for AI Agentic Systems](#)
> 3. [A Lean Methodology for AI Agentic Development](#)
```

**Implementation:**

- Add to each article after title/description
- Update links once articles are published
- Consistent formatting across all 3

---

## Content Strategy

### Target Audience

**Primary:**

- Traditional web developers transitioning to AI
- Solo founders building AI products
- Engineers curious about AI development

**Secondary:**

- AI builders looking for structure
- Technical leaders evaluating approaches
- Potential customers/partners

### Positioning

**Unique angle:**

- Bridge between traditional and AI development
- Not just tech, not just theory - practical methodology
- Real experience, real failures, real solutions

**Differentiation:**

- Most AI content is either pure tech or pure business
- This bridges methodology and practice
- Shows evolution, not just final state

---

## Publication Plan

### Immediate (Now)

**Action:** Publish all 3 articles on nickthiru.dev with placeholder dates

**Why:**

- Pad website with substantial content
- Show depth and expertise
- Have content ready for distribution

**Dates:** Use placeholder dates (will backdate later)

### Later (Soon)

**Action:** Review all article dates and space them out appropriately

**Spacing suggestion:**

- Article 1: [Start date - TBD]
- Article 2: [Start date + 1 week]
- Article 3: [Start date + 2 weeks]

**Considerations:**

- Choose realistic start date for blog
- Space weekly for consistency
- Align with other content timeline

---

## Links and References

### Internal Links (To Add)

**In each article:**

- Links to other articles in series
- Link to newsletter signup
- Link to build log (once available)
- Link to LinkedIn Ghostwriter product page

### External Links (Placeholders)

**GitHub Documentation:**

- Full methodology documentation (generic, not SMW-specific)
- **Current status:** Private SMW repo
- **Action needed:** Clean up docs, make generic, publish to public repo
- **Placeholder in articles:** `[Full Methodology Documentation (GitHub)](#)`
- **Update when ready:** Replace `#` with actual GitHub URL

**Note:** This is a separate task - don't block article publication on this

### LinkedIn Post Template

```
I spent 3 years building a web dev methodology.

Then I tried to apply it to AI agents. It failed spectacularly.

Here's what I learned about the fundamental difference between building traditional apps and AI agentic systems:

### X/Twitter Thread Template

```
1/ I tried to apply my web dev methodology to building an AI agent.

It didn't work. Here's why 🧵

2/ Traditional web apps are engineering problems:
- Deterministic behavior
- Predictable outcomes
- Design upfront, implement to spec

3/ AI agentic systems are discovery problems:
- Non-deterministic outputs
- Emergent behavior
- Build to learn, iterate to improve
