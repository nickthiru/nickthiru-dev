## 🔒 Privacy & Sharing Guidelines

### ✅ Always Safe to Share

- User growth percentages and trends
- Conversion rates and engagement metrics
- Even failures and lessons learned
- Time spent on development and productivity insights

**Process & Learnings:**

- How you built features and made decisions
- Technical process without proprietary details
- Mistakes made and what you learned
- Customer insights (anonymized)
- Productivity tips and time management
- Behind-the-scenes development journey

**Personal & Relatable:**

- Your motivation for building
- Struggles, doubts, and breakthroughs
- Work-life balance challenges
- Celebrations and small wins
- Daily routines and work patterns

**Product Updates:**

- New features and what they solve
- Bug fixes and improvements
- Roadmap progress and plans
- User feedback (anonymized)
- Design iterations and decisions

### ❌ Never Share Without Explicit Permission

**Competitive Secrets:**

- Unique algorithms or proprietary IP
- Detailed technical architecture that's your moat
- Upcoming pivots before they're public
- Acquisition negotiations or discussions
- Specific technical implementations that create competitive advantage

**Customer Data & Privacy:**

- Specific customer names without permission
- Private feedback or communications
- Usage data or analytics that identify individuals
- Screenshots with identifying information
- Financial details of enterprise deals

**Legal/Financial Sensitive:**

- Cap table details or investor information
- Specific contract terms or negotiations
- Pending lawsuits or legal issues
- Tax strategies or financial planning
- Internal business metrics that could create risk

**Personal Safety:**

- Home address or location details
- Family information that could create safety issues
- Anything that makes you uncomfortable
- Personal contact information

### 🎯 Decision Framework

**When in doubt, ask:**

1. **Could this help competitors?** → Keep private
2. **Could this create security risk?** → Keep private
3. **Could this identify specific customers?** → Keep private
4. **Is this about the pattern/learning?** → Share the pattern
5. **Is this about the specific sensitive detail?** → Keep private

**Rule of Thumb:** Share the pattern and learning, not the exploitable detail. Share the why, not the parts that create risk.
