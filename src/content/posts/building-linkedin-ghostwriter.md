I'm building LinkedIn Ghostwriter—an AI agent that transforms voice notes into authentic LinkedIn posts.

## The Problem

Most founders know they should post consistently on LinkedIn. But writing feels like a chore:

- Staring at a blank text box
- Overthinking every word
- Sounding too corporate or too casual
- Spending 30+ minutes per post

Meanwhile, explaining your ideas out loud? That's natural. That's where your authentic voice lives.

## The Solution

LinkedIn Ghostwriter lets you:

1. Record a voice note (2-5 minutes)
2. Get a draft that sounds like you
3. Review, edit if needed
4. Schedule or post immediately

The agent learns your style over time—your sentence structure, your vocabulary, your tone. It's not generic AI writing. It's your voice, captured and refined.

## What We're Building

**Core features:**

- Voice-to-text with style learning
- Quality gates (no generic fluff)
- Scheduling system
- Analytics on what resonates

**Technical approach:**

- LangGraph for agent orchestration
- Custom style analysis pipeline
- Feedback loops for continuous improvement

## Current Status

We're in early development. The core voice-to-draft pipeline is working. Now we're focused on:

- Style learning accuracy
- Quality gate refinement
- Building the scheduling system

## Why This Matters

LinkedIn is where technical founders build their audience. But most tools either:

- Generate generic AI slop
- Require too much manual work
- Don't preserve your voice

We're building something different. Something that amplifies your voice, not replaces it.

Want to follow along? I'll be sharing build logs, technical decisions, and early results as we go.
