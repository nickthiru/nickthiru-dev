This is the first test post to verify the RSS-to-email integration.

## What we're testing

- RSS feed detection by Buttondown
- Email template rendering
- Post title and description display
- Link back to the full post

## Expected behavior

When Buttondown checks the RSS feed, it should:

1. Detect this new post
2. Create a draft email
3. Populate the email with post title and description
4. Include a link to read the full post

If you're reading this in your email inbox, the integration is working correctly!
