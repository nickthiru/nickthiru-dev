This is the second test post to verify that multiple posts can be handled correctly.

## Testing multiple posts

When you have multiple new posts in a single RSS check, Buttondown should:

- Display both posts in the same email
- Maintain proper formatting for each
- Keep them clearly separated

## Why this matters

Your weekly digest might include multiple posts, so we need to ensure:

1. Each post is clearly distinguished
2. Titles are prominent
3. Descriptions are readable
4. Links work correctly

## Next steps

Once both test posts appear in the email correctly:

- Delete these test posts
- Start publishing real content
- Trust the automation to work

Success means you can focus on writing, not email delivery!
