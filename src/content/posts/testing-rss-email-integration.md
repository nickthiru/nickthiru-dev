This is a test post to verify the RSS-to-email integration with Buttondown.

## What we're testing

- RSS feed generation
- Buttondown feed parsing
- Email template rendering
- Post content display in emails

## Why this matters

Getting the RSS-to-email flow right means:

- Subscribers automatically get new posts
- No manual work sending emails
- Consistent delivery experience

## Next steps

Once this test works, we can:

1. Publish real content
2. Trust the automation
3. Focus on writing, not distribution

If you're reading this in your inbox, it worked!
