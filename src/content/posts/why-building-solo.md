I should probably address the thing a lot of people notice immediately:

I’m building Thiru AI Labs solo.

No co-founder. No team. No “we” behind the curtain.

If you’re evaluating us as a potential solution, it’s fair to wonder whether that’s a red flag. In B2B, team size has traditionally been shorthand for stability.

But here’s the tradeoff I’ve learned the hard way:

**team size is a weak proxy for execution capacity when you’re AI-augmented.**

And for the kinds of customers I care about most — micro, small, and medium businesses — execution speed and direct access often matter more than headcount.

## The old rules (and why they’re breaking)

A decade ago, solo meant you were constrained by time:

- you could only ship so much
- you could only support so many customers
- you had to choose between building, selling, and operating

AI doesn’t magically remove those constraints, but it **changes the math**.

I still make every important decision. I still review everything. I still own the outcomes.

But AI eliminates a lot of the “team tax” work:

- drafting code + refactors (then I review)
- creating repeatable infrastructure (then I validate)
- documenting systems (so nothing lives only in my head)
- automating common support and ops tasks

The result isn’t “one person pretending to be a company.”

The result is a lean studio that can ship production-grade systems without the overhead of a full team.

## What you get as a customer

This is the part that matters.

If you’re a customer (or potential customer), being solo changes the relationship in some ways that are actually positive.

### 1. Speed

No committees. No handoffs. No internal politics.

If you report a bug or request a feature, I can:

- evaluate it quickly
- ship it faster
- iterate based on your feedback immediately

### 2. Direct access

You’re not talking to:

- a support tier reading from a script
- a sales rep who doesn’t know the system
- a PM relaying messages back and forth

You’re talking to the builder.

That means when you ask “why does it work like this?” you get a real answer — including the tradeoffs.

### 3. Incentive alignment

My incentives are boring and simple:

- if the product works and keeps delivering value, I win
- if it doesn’t, I lose

I’m not optimizing for investor optics.

I’m optimizing for outcomes that matter to customers:

- reliability
- time saved
- fewer mistakes
- lower operational friction

### 4. Focus

No management overhead.

My time goes into:

- building
- fixing
- supporting
- shipping

That’s it.

### 5. Transparency

Being solo makes it easier to be honest.

No corporate PR filter. No “let me check with legal.”

Just: here’s what I’m building, here’s why, here’s what’s working, and here’s what isn’t.

## The risks (and what I’m doing about them)

You don’t have to pretend the risks don’t exist.

I’d rather call them out directly.

### “What if you get hit by a bus?”

Fair question.

This is how I mitigate it:

- **Documentation**: architecture docs, deployment guides, operational runbooks
- **Infrastructure as Code**: reproducible environments, no “mystery server” knowledge
- **Standard patterns**: nothing exotic that only I can maintain
- **Transition plan**: clear process for customer data + ongoing operations

### “Can you handle support?”

Yes — with boundaries and systems.

- clear response windows
- automated monitoring so issues are caught early
- AI-assisted triage for common questions
- honest capacity management (if I can’t serve customers well, I pause growth)

## Who this is for (and who it’s not)

### You should work with me if:

- you value speed and direct access
- you’re operating lean (or you want to)
- you want a focused solution that solves one problem well

### You should not work with me if:

- you need enterprise procurement + 24/7 phone support
- you want a generic platform that does everything
- you’re only comfortable with established vendors

I’m not trying to be everything to everyone.

I’m building for customers who care about outcomes.

## Your turn

If you’ve worked with a solo builder before, what did you love about it? What made you nervous?

And if you’re building solo right now: what’s the biggest constraint you’re feeling?
