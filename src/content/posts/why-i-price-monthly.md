Every SaaS pricing guide tells you the same thing: offer annual plans with a discount. Lock in revenue. Reduce churn. It's the smart move.

I'm doing the opposite. Here's why.

## The standard advice

The argument for annual billing is compelling:

- **Upfront cash**: 12 months of revenue today instead of dripped over a year
- **Lower churn**: People who pay annually are less likely to cancel (sunk cost)
- **Predictability**: Easier to forecast when you know revenue is locked in

For established products, this makes total sense. If you know your product works and customers stick around, annual billing is free money.

But I'm not there yet.

## The early-stage reality

When you're still finding product-market fit, annual billing creates problems:

**You can't iterate fast enough**. If someone pays for a year and your product changes significantly, you've got a mismatch. They paid for Thing A, you're now building Thing B.

**Feedback loops slow down**. Monthly subscribers vote with their feet every 30 days. That's painful, but it's also honest signal. Annual subscribers might be silently unhappy for months.

**Refund requests hurt more**. A monthly subscriber who cancels costs you $20. An annual subscriber who demands a refund after 3 months costs you the full amount plus the support overhead.

**Price discovery is harder**. Want to raise prices? With monthly billing, new subscribers pay the new rate. With annual, you've got cohorts locked in at different prices for a year.

## My current approach

Right now, I offer monthly only:

- **$29/month** for the core product
- No annual option
- Cancel anytime, no questions asked

This hurts my metrics. My MRR growth looks worse than it would with annual billing. My churn rate looks higher.

But I'm learning faster.

Every month, I see exactly how many people think the product is worth $29. When someone cancels, I reach out and ask why. That feedback loop is tight enough to act on.

## When I'll switch

I'll add annual billing when:

1. **Retention stabilizes**: Month 3+ retention above 85%
2. **Core features stabilize**: I'm iterating on edges, not foundations
3. **Customer requests**: Multiple people asking for annual (signal of commitment)

Until then, the monthly pain is worth the learning speed.

## The uncomfortable truth

Annual billing is an optimization. Optimizing too early is a trap.

If your product isn't working, annual billing won't save it—it'll just delay the reckoning. Better to know now that something's wrong than to find out in 12 months when a cohort doesn't renew.

The best practice advice assumes you've got the basics right. If you're still figuring that out, optimize for learning, not revenue.
