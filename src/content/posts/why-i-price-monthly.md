Every SaaS pricing guide tells you the same thing:

“Offer annual. Give a discount. Lock in cash.”

And if you’re already at product-market fit, that advice is hard to argue with.

But I’m doing the opposite right now.

Not because I don’t like money. Because I like **clean learning signals** more.

## The standard advice (and why it’s usually right)

Annual billing has real benefits:

- **Upfront cash**: 12 months of revenue today
- **Lower churn**: annual customers cancel less (sunk cost is real)
- **Predictability**: forecasting gets easier

For mature products, annual is basically an optimization cheat code.

## The early-stage reality (the part people skip)

When you’re still finding product-market fit, annual billing can create distortions.

### 1. You can’t iterate fast enough

If someone pays for a year and you change the product significantly, you get misalignment:

- they paid for Thing A
- you’re now building Thing B

That’s a recipe for refunds, frustration, and awkward conversations.

### 2. Your feedback loop slows down

Monthly customers vote every 30 days.

That’s painful… but it’s honest.

Annual customers can be unhappy for months without telling you.

### 3. Refund requests hurt more

A monthly cancel is a small hit.

An annual refund after 3 months is a big hit plus support overhead.

### 4. Price discovery gets messy

If you change pricing, monthly lets you adjust for new customers quickly.

Annual locks cohorts into old pricing for a long time.

## My current approach

Right now I’m keeping it simple:

- **$29/month** for the core product
- no annual option
- cancel anytime

This makes my metrics look worse than they could:

- MRR growth is slower
- churn looks higher

But the signal is clean.

Every month, I learn one thing: **is this product worth $29 to enough people?**

## When I’ll add annual

Here’s the decision framework I’m using.

I’ll introduce annual billing when:

1. **Retention stabilizes**
   - month 3+ retention consistently > 85%
2. **The core stops moving**
   - I’m iterating on edges, not foundations
3. **Customers ask for it**
   - multiple customers request annual (signal of commitment)

Until then, I’m optimizing for learning speed.

## The uncomfortable truth

Annual billing is an optimization.

Optimizing too early is a trap.

If your product isn’t working, annual billing won’t save it — it’ll just delay the reckoning.

## Your turn

If you introduced annual early:

- did it help you learn faster or slower?
- did it reduce churn or hide churn?

I’d love the counter-arguments. Reply on X:
