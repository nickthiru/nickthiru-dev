go-to-market engineering (gtm) is a new concept. i discovered it when i asked ai about how to approach thiru ai labs partnerships.

in the context of this article, however, i'm using it to refer to the process of engineering a go-to-market strategy for thiru ai labs itseif.

i can update the "why buiding solo" article to include this, because gtm is about automating the go-to-market process. and one of the things mentioned in the article about my ability to go solo is about using ai to automate and do the heavy-lifting, which will also apply to the gtm system.
